Prompt to Generate Classified Plugin & UI Theme
I have a monorepo full stack project structured like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
apps/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                      # Main Strapi backend
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/plugins/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metajob-backend/     # Plugin for job board (APIs and logic)

packages/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metajob-theme/               # Frontend UI using MUI for job board
Now I want to build a new solution for a Classified Ads marketplace. Follow the same structure, logic, and component design as the existing metajob setup.

üß© Backend Plugin: classifieds-backend
Create a new Strapi plugin inside apps/backend/src/plugins/classifieds-backend

Follow the same folder structure, code style, and naming conventions as metajob-backend

Create all necessary collections and APIs for a Classified Ads site, such as:

listings (title, price, description, location, category, images, user, etc.)

categories (for organizing listings)

messages (for user-to-user communication)

favorites (user bookmarks)

locations (cities or regions)

user profiles

listing stats endpoint (e.g., total ads, ads per category, etc.)

Make it modular and scoped within the plugin, with clean services and controllers like in metajob-backend.

üé® UI Theme: classifieds-theme
Create a new UI package inside packages/classifieds-theme

Clone the structure of metajob-theme, but adapt it for classified ads

Use MUI (Material UI) for components, consistent with the job board

Include reusable components for:

Listing Cards

Filters Sidebar (location, category, price)

Listing Details Page

Submit Listing Form

Search & Sorting

Chat / Messaging UI

Dashboard for managing user listings and favorites

Make sure theme works as a standalone installable package like metajob-theme

‚ùå Do Not Modify:
The core backend or frontend

Existing plugins or themes

Just create a new plugin (classifieds-backend) and theme (classifieds-theme) in the correct locations

Make sure all code is:

Well-organized

Production-ready

Follows the same conventions as metajob solution
